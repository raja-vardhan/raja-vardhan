## 👋 Hi there, I’m Rajavardhan Reddy Siriganagari (Raj)

I’m a **Computer Science Master’s student at the University of Utah**, with a deep focus on **distributed systems, databases, and operating systems**. I enjoy building systems close to the metal, reasoning about correctness and performance, and turning research ideas into working prototypes.

### Key Projects
* **[Distributed key-value store](https://github.com/raja-vardhan/kvstore-deadlock-policies)** - Supports sharding, uses RPC for communication, YCSB workloads for benchmarking, and strict serializability using 2PL + 2PC. Compared the performance of three deadlock avoidance strategies: no-wait, wait-die, and wound-wait.
* **[DebugSQL](https://github.com/raja-vardhan/debugsql)** - CLI tool to explain unexpected query results (aggregate, join, predicate, why-not analysis)
* **Rust-based x86-64 microkernel** - Implementing boot, low-level CPU structures (GDT/IDT/TSS), paging, and buddy memory allocator.

### I’m currently learning

* **GPU programming**: CUDA, fast and verified GPU code
* **LLMs and Agentic AI**
* **Managing data for ML**: Data processing, Spark
* **Compilers**
* **Software verification**

### I’m looking to collaborate on

* Open-source projects in **distributed systems, databases, or storage engines**
* Systems projects that care deeply about **correctness, performance, concurrency, and scalability**
